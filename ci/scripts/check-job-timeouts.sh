# Every job in .github/workflows/*.yml must carry a timeout-minutes.
#
# An unbounded job that hangs holds a runner for six hours and refuses to serve
# its log while it does, so the failing test cannot even be named until someone
# cancels the run. That has happened here.
#
# Deliberately not a YAML-library parse: a job that runs inside a minimal
# container would need an extra package for that, and the
# indentation is exact enough for the one distinction that matters — a
# job-level timeout-minutes (four spaces) is not a step-level one (eight), and
# this project's own CI file carries both.
#
# Scans relative to the current directory, so a repository without its own copy
# can borrow one.
